This project was a fantastic opportunity to enhance my front-end development skills, focusing on: 
 
- Building responsive layouts to ensure seamless browsing across devices 📱💻 
- Creating a user-friendly interface with intuitive navigation 🔍 
- Styling and structuring pages to mimic the aesthetic and functionality of the popular Myntra platform 🌟 
 
Key highlights: 
- Included Search items

This project has helped me further develop my skills in HTML and CSS while gaining a deeper understanding of e-commerce site architecture.
